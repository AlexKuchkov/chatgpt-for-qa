# Master Checklist for Using ChatGPT in QA Work

A detailed, practical guide for Quality Assurance Engineers to leverage ChatGPT effectively in day-to-day tasks.


## Test Case Generation from User Stories

- Convert user stories or acceptance criteria into test cases
- Include preconditions, test steps, expected and actual results
- Generate edge cases, boundary tests, and negative test scenarios

## Exploratory Testing Ideas

- Suggest exploratory test charters using heuristics (SFDIPOT, RCRCRC, HICCUPPS)
- Identify high-risk features to focus exploratory sessions
- Outline goals, duration, and coverage for session-based testing

## Bug Report Structuring

- Format bug reports clearly with: Title, Steps to Reproduce, Expected vs Actual, Severity
- Rewrite unclear bug reports into well-structured, actionable items
- Suggest probable root causes using logs or observed behavior

## Postman or API Test Creation

- Generate cURL, Postman, or HTTP request samples for APIs
- Create Postman test scripts to validate response code, body, headers
- Help with authorization headers, environments, and pre-request scripts

## XPath/CSS Selector Generation

- Build XPath/CSS selectors for web elements from raw HTML
- Handle dynamic elements with `contains()`, `starts-with()`, etc.
- Analyze selector stability for robust automation

## Automation Script Generation

- Generate Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, or Appium test code
- Convert manual test cases into automation scripts
- Set up page object models or framework scaffolding
- Refactor or debug automation code with explanations

## Jira Issue Templates

- Create templates for:
  - Bug Reports
  - User Stories
  - Test Cases
- Format using Markdown or Jira Wiki syntax
- Suggest concise and consistent issue naming

## Documentation Rewriting

- Improve QA documents like:
  - Test Plans
  - QA Strategies
  - Release Checklists
- Translate technical detail into stakeholder-friendly summaries
- Format docs for GitHub or Confluence

## Test Data Generation

- Generate realistic test data (emails, names, numbers, etc.)
- Provide edge cases like:
  - Special characters
  - SQL injection inputs
  - Long/short input values
- Create JSON or XML payloads for API testing

## Interview Prep Support

- Simulate technical and behavioral interviews
- Generate QA interview questions (manual, automation, API)
- Review and improve resume and portfolio content
- Practice STAR-method answers for situational questions

## Learning Roadmap Planning

- Suggest weekly or monthly learning paths for:
  - Automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Playwright)
  - Testing skills (e.g., API testing, performance testing)
- Curate free and paid resources (docs, videos, hands-on tasks)
- Break learning into phases with goals and milestones
