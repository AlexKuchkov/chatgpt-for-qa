## Use Cases for QA Engineers

### 1. Test Case Design & Test Planning
-  Generate detailed test cases from feature descriptions or user stories
-  Create boundary value & equivalence partitioning tests
-  List negative test scenarios
-  Create acceptance criteria for new features
-  Suggest exploratory test ideas based on risk areas

**Example Prompt:**
> "Generate functional and negative test cases for a login form with email and password fields."


### 2. Bug Reporting & Debugging Help
-  Structure professional bug reports (title, steps, expected/actual result)
-  Summarize logs or error messages
-  Suggest potential causes for browser/API errors
-  Translate technical details for non-technical stakeholders

**Example Prompt:**
> "Write a Jira-style bug report for a failed image upload on Safari macOS."


### 3. Manual Testing Assistance
-  Design test scenarios based on exploratory heuristics (SFDIPOT, RCRCRC)
-  Help identify missing edge cases in test suites
-  Generate form input test data
-  Simulate user behavior in complex flows

**Example Prompt:**
> "List edge test scenarios for a shopping cart checkout page."


### 4. Automation Support

-  Explain REST/GraphQL test strategy
-  Generate test data for JSON requests
-  Mock API responses or test schemas

**Example Prompt:**
> "Write a Postman test to validate the response code and body for a user login API."


### 6. Documentation & Communication
-  Clean up or rewrite messy bug descriptions
-  Create QA documentation templates (test plans, reports)
-  Translate QA docs into clear, professional English
-  Convert testing notes into Jira tickets

**Example Prompt:**
> "Rewrite this rough test report into professional summary for stakeholders."


### 7. QA Career Support
